# FRAUD Project Portfolio: Advanced Data Analysis and Machine Learning Applications

## Overview
This repository contains two advanced data analysis and machine learning projects aimed at providing actionable insights through sophisticated modeling techniques. These projects were developed to address specific challenges in anomaly detection in property valuations and fraud detection in credit card transactions.

### Project Titles:
1. **New York Property Valuation Anomaly Detection**
2. **Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions**

## Project Descriptions

### 1. New York Property Valuation Anomaly Detection
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in property valuations across New York City to enhance the accuracy and fairness of property tax assessments. Utilizing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, this analysis delves into a comprehensive dataset featuring over a million property records. The goal is to identify discrepancies that may indicate erroneous assessments or fraudulent activities.

**Key Techniques Used:**
- Data Cleaning and Integration
- Variable Creation for Anomaly Detection
- Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- Advanced Anomaly Detection Algorithms

### 2. Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions
Developed a robust machine learning model using LightGBM to identify and prevent credit card fraud. The model processes nearly 100,000 transactions to detect patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities. This project not only aims to reduce financial losses due to fraud but also enhances the security of credit card transactions.

**Key Techniques Used:**
- Comprehensive Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering to Enhance Model Accuracy
- LightGBM for Efficient Learning
- Financial Impact Analysis and Model Optimization

## Technologies Used
Both projects leverage a sophisticated stack of technologies and libraries to process data and develop predictive models efficiently.

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  - Scikit-learn, PyRSM, and XGBoost for machine learning
  - LightGBM for gradient boosting frameworks
